// test3.data:  A general all-around workout.
// This is similar to test2.data, but with better comments and a few more 
// tests.

// 1. Format the disk with 100 blocks total, of which 10 are inode blocks
formatDisk 100 10

// 2. Create file inum1 with 10012 bytes of data.
file1 = create
inum1 = inumber file1
write file1 ItKeepsGoing 12
// Result should be 12
write file1 AndGoing 10000
// Result should be 10000

// 3. In file1, back up 10 bytes and try to read 50.  We should get the last
// 10 bytes in the file ("ngAndGoing").
seek file1 -10 1
// Result should be 1002 (the new offset)
read file1 50
// Result should be 10 (only 10 bytes left)

// 4. File inum2 consists of 1000 nulls followed by 500 copies of "Yo"
// The first block should be a "hole" and the second should have "Yo" in
// the last last 24 bytes, with the rest filled with nulls.
file2 = create
inum2 = inumber file2
seek file2 1000 0
// Result should be 1000
write file2 Yo 1000
// Result should be 1000

// 5. In file2, seek to 1010 bytes before the end of the file and read 50 bytes
seek file2 -1010 2
// Result should be 990 (total length of file is 2000)
read file2 50
// Result should be 50 (asked for 50 bytes and got all 50)
// String printed should be
// \0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0YoYoYoYoYoYoYoYoYoYoYoYoYoYoYoYoYoYoYoYo

// 6. Read the first 50 bytes of file2.  This is a hole, so we should get nulls.
seek file2 0 0
// Result should be 0
read file2 50
// Result should be 50

// 7. Close the first file (inum1, file1)
inumber file1
// Result should be 1
close file1
// Result should be 0

// 8. Create inum3: 1000 bytes of "Foo", a 10-byte gap, and 1000 bytes of "Bar"
file3 = create
write file3 Foo 1000
seek file3 10 1
write file3 Bar 1000

// 9. Check that the gap is filled with 10 nulls
seek file3 990 0
read file3 30
// Should print "FooFooFooF\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0BarBarBarB"

// 10. Reopen first file (the large "Energizer Bunny" file)
file1 = open inum1
// Result should probably be 2, but it depends on how you implemented FileTable

// 11. Read back the first 50 bytes.  They should be
// ItKeepsGoingAndGoingAndGoingAndGoingAndGoingAndGoi
read file1 50

// 12. Close file 2 (the YoYo file)
inumber file2
close file2

// 13. Delete the file (the YoYo file)
delete inum2

// 14. Now try to reopen the file we just deleted (should be an error)
open inum2

// 15. Shut down and quit
shutdown
quit
