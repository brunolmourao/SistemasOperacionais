// test7pt1.data:  This is the first of a series of two tests that checks for
// running out of disk blocks.  This one will check what happens when you
// need a DATA block and there are none left.

// 1. Format the disk with 10 blocks total, of which 4 are inode blocks.
formatDisk 10 4

// 2. Create two files -- each of which fill up 2 blocks
file1 = create
write file1 Bill_the_Cat_ 1024
file2 = create
write file2 Opus_the_Penguin_ 1024

// 3. At this point, we should have 1 block left (remember the superblock).
//    Open a third file and write 1 block to it.
file3 = create
write file3 Milo_ 512

// 4. Now we have no blocks left.  Write a final block to the third file.
write file3 Portnoy_ 512

// 5. We should have an error for running out of disk blocks.  If the program 
//    did not terminate, then shutdown and quit.
shutdown
quit
