// test7pt2.data:  This is the second of a series of two tests that checks for
// running out of disk blocks.  This one will check what happens when you
// need an INDIRECT block and there are none left.

// 1. Format the disk with 100 blocks total, of which 10 are inode blocks.
formatDisk 100 10

// 2. Create two files -- each of which fill up 43 blocks (44 blocks if
//    the indirect block is included).
file1 = create
write file1 Bill_the_Cat_ 22016
file2 = create
write file2 Opus_the_Penguin_ 22016

// 3. At this point, we should have 1 block left (remember the superblock).
//    Open a third file and write 1 block to it (using double indirection).
//    Choose block position 10000 in the file.
file3 = create
seek file3 5120000 0
write file3 Milo_ 512

// 4. We should have an error for running out of disk blocks.  If the program 
//    did not terminate, then shutdown and quit.
shutdown
quit
