// test8.data:  Checks that file blocks are being correctly returned to the

// alternate files.  And continue to create new, and larger, files until
// there is one large file.  This test also makes sure that at a

//    and 16 data blocks).

// 2. Create 16 1-block files to fill up the file table and use all blocks
