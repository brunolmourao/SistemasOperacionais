// test5pt1.data:  Tests the flushing of data to disk.
// This is the first part of a two part test.  It will open up numerous
// files, flush their contents to disk, and then shutdown the system.  The
// second part of this test will read the files back in.  You should run
// the second test after running the first (i.e. do not run other tests
// in-between).
// IMPORTANT: In order for this test to work correctly, your shutdown() 
// function must call Disk.stop(false) -- else the disk file will be cleared 
// in between these tests.  Further, you must be assigning inumbers in order
// starting with 1.

// 1. Format the disk with 100 blocks total, of which 10 are inode blocks
formatDisk 100 10

// 2. Create file1: has 2 contiguous blocks from the start
file1 = create
inum1 = inumber file1
// IMPORTANT: result for inumber should be 1

// Blocks 0-1
write file1 Happiness_ 1024

// 3. Create file2: has 1 singly-indirect block, not block aligned
file2 = create
inum2 = inumber file2
// IMPORTANT: result for inumber should be 2

// Blocks 20-21
seek file2 10496 0
write file2 is_a_ 512

// 4. Create file3: has 2 sets of 3 indirect blocks, not block aligned
file3 = create
inum3 = inumber file3
// IMPORTANT: result for inumber should be 3

// Blocks 143-146
seek file3 73472 0
write file3 warm_puppy_ 1536

// Blocks 130221-130224
seek file3 66673408 0
write file3 warm_puppy_ 1536

// 3. Close all files
close file1
close file2
close file3

// 4. Shut down and quit
shutdown
quit
