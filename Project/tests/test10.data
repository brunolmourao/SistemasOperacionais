// test10.data:  Checks that file blocks are being correctly returned to the
// free list.  It is similar to test8, however this time we are going
// to be checking to see if the blocks used in double and triple indirection
// are correctly returned.  At the very end of the test, you should get an
// ERROR as we run out of disk blocks.

// 1. Format the disk with 11 blocks total: (1 superblock, 1 inode block,
//    and 9 data blocks).
formatDisk 11 1

// 2. Write 4 triple-indirect blocks.  Write them so that 9 blocks are
//    needed.  (You can think about how this is done.)  I will choose
//    blocks 98,441 - 98,444

// 4. Now write 6 double-indirect blocks.  Write them so that 9 blocks are
