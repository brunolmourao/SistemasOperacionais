This project requires implementing the FileSystem.java
interface.  We have provided the class JavaFileSystem.java
which implements this interface, although all methods
currently throw a RuntimeException. Your task is to 
remove the RuntimeException and add the logic to each method.

Your implementation may be tested using the TestFS.java
class. This class may be invoked by entering the name of one
of the test scripts in the tests directory. For example, to 
test the script test1.data, you would enter

java TestFS ./tests/test1.data

Furthermore, you may use just a command line interface
in TestFS.java to test specific methods. If you were to enter:

	java TestFS

you are presented with the following prompt:

	-->

where you may enter one of the commands that are specified in
the test scripts. For example, to format the disk, you would enter:

	--> formatDisk 10 2

To create a file, you would enter

	--> file = create

To get the inumber of a file, enter:

	--> inum = inumber file

Scan through the test scripts to see how to enter the command specific
to each method in the FileSystem interface.
